        <h2>Handled Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Credit Limit 2023</h3>
            <p>This is my first project and one of the biggest in terms of people involved.Basically Adira wants
to reward its loyal customers by providing them new contract number customized for them. I
was assigned to handle the payment regular module in Warehouse system. I was
responsibled especially from the data flow from the bidder selection until it appears in the
journal of AM division.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Mobile</h3>
            <p>This is the project of providing mobile contract with it’s own PP type. I was handling the
warning letter menu</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project Notifikasi Delinquency A3/A4</h3>
            <p>I handled how the system could send the notification for the responsibled people via SMS
through ESB</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>PProject Perubahan Jabatan CCH Recovery</h3>
            <p>Basically there was a slight changes of the role of the Recovery Officer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Validasi Billing Address</h3>
            <p>There was a menu called Billing Address, which controls the address of the customers. We
wanted to close the system on certain dates. We made it parametrized through the database
so whenever the Headquarter Users wants to change the date, they could just ask the IT team
to use some scripts to update the date.</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project BPR Pemanjangan Length Parameter Asset</h3>
            <p>This project adds more length of VARCHAR from VARCHAR2(30) until VARCHAR2(50).
Sounds simple, right? But actually the impact is huge. We altered the column of Model Code,
Brand Code, and Type Code to VARCHAR2(50), and the impact was everywhere in the
system. I was responsibled for the Warehouse (Remarket) menu, specifically bidding process,
and also the Recovery menus.</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project Golden Record 2nd Phase</h3>
            <p>I could proudly say that I was arguably the one of who contributes to this project the most. We
started with 4 people, and 2 of us resigned. My manager relied on me the most of this project.
This project was quite long, from mid of 2022 to the end of 2023. So basically, there were
website of Billing Address environment, and Mobile, which was handled by the Third Party
Vendor called PT Inovasi Addins.
We used REST API to POST the updated address to the certain API. And then when we
wanted to display the most recent updated address, we used the GET method. And also from
the addins site, they updated lots of version of their APK and I was the one responsibled for
versioning the APK from time to time. Also on the web end, the UAT phase was so long. I had
to udpate the scoring from day by day just so the Headquarter user could test the data, since
the data won’t show if it’s not updated per it’s respective days, and the UAT environment did
not have automatic date updating feature just like hte production environment. I usually
updated the scoring with the devops team.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project SPPI</h3>
            <p>I handled the menu of View and Upload document of the new format of SPPI and also the new
workflow menu customized for the SPPI</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project Enhancement Workflow</h3>
            <p>I could say this is one of my favorite projects. I was on my third year on this project, and I
kinda lead the two other QAs. So basically we wanted to add a new kind of workflow, and
adds the overdue feature on the existing workflow. And we used a lot of parametrized to
support many kinds of date conditions.</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project Manajemen Bidder</h3>
            <p>I was also on my third year on this project. We added a new menu called ‘Jaminan Bidder’.It
basically shows the certain area codes and transportation types, such as motorcycles, cars,
and heavy equipments. And the tricky part was, there was another more important warehouse
project that was prioritzed way more than this project, and I had to reversioned the code after
another project went into the production.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Automation Revisit</h3>
            <p>This is also one of my favorite project. So basically we handled the action code from another
division. And we shows a whole different kind of questions depending of the action code from
another division. And also we integrated the web with the third party apps from addins. And we
used SSIS to synchronize the data.</p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="project">
            <h3>Project Sapient</h3>
            <p>This is my last project before I resigned, and could be the most exhausting one in terms of
overtime. The timeline of this project was arguably short compared to the scope. So basically
the standard chartered bank has some businesses with Adira and we had to provide for the
new ‘SCB’ contract. Fortunately, I had a lot of help from my developer on this one. I handled
how the contract was built for this ‘SCB’ contract and the Reposses Menu.</p>
